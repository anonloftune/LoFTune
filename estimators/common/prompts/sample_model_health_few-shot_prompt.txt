INPUT: Answer the following question in a single paragraph: "How does COVID-19 spread between people?"
OUTPUT: Current evidence suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 virus spreads mainly between people who are in close contact with each other, for example at a conversational distance. The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. Another person can then contract the virus when infectious particles that pass through the air are inhaled at short range (this is often called short-range aerosol or short-range airborne transmission) or if infectious particles come into direct contact with the eyes, nose, or mouth (droplet transmission). The virus can also spread in poorly ventilated and/or crowded indoor settings, where people tend to spend longer periods of time. This is because aerosols can remain suspended in the air or travel farther than conversational distance (this is often called long-range aerosol or long-range airborne transmission). People may also become infected when touching their eyes, nose or mouth after touching surfaces or objects that have been contaminated by the virus.

INPUT: Answer the following question in a single paragraph: "When do infected people transmit the SARS-CoV-2 virus?"
OUTPUT: Whether or not they have symptoms, infected people can be contagious and the virus can spread from them to other people. Laboratory data suggests that infected people appear to be most infectious just before they develop symptoms (namely 2 days before they develop symptoms) and early in their illness. People who develop severe disease can be infectious for longer. While someone who never develops symptoms can pass the virus to others, it is still not clear how frequently this occurs and more research is needed in this area.

INPUT: Answer the following question in a single paragraph: "Are there certain settings where COVID-19 can spread more easily?"
OUTPUT: Yes, any situation in which people are in close proximity to one another for long periods of time increases the risk of transmission. Indoor locations, especially settings where there is poor ventilation, are riskier than outdoor locations. Activities where more particles are expelled from the mouth, such as singing or breathing heavily during exercise, also increase the risk of transmission. The “Three C’s” are a useful way to think about this. They describe settings where transmission of the COVID-19 virus spreads more easily: Crowded places, Close-contact settings -especially where people have conversations very near each other-, Confined and enclosed spaces with poor ventilation. The risk of COVID-19 spreading is especially high in places where these “3Cs” overlap.
